IMPORTANT: Absolutely screw this for now rofl. The complexity of this absolutely exploded way beyond what I'm ready for. All I want out of this is a single map, a single player, my 10 cycling resources just like I had, and maybe 5 cycling enemies to kill that move around and attack back. Maybe build out a simple repair button and then probs leave it at that - end of the project

Next project should just be marginally more complex

enemies stop moving and attack back (skip the runaway phase)
heal while at base
player death
level up
add a boss on 1-4?
add aggressive enemies?
add enemies higher level on other maps?
make 2-3 different types of enemies?
upgrades, increase dmg/speed/health/collectionBonus?
add map name to top center of canvas

# add portals to go to 1 other map

should attack range/resource collection range be the same thing?

what if there was a stun CD?
  combined with attack range increase, you could pretty much kite

what about rockets?

what about repairing away from base?
  what about a health potion or something?
  purchase the ability to heal at portals?

add health bars above player/enemy during combat

add dmg numbers into canvas during combat

add enemy targetting via mouse

what if there was good AoE and a very long-range, weak attack for pulling enemies?

what if I made this or another game like a Diablo-oriented pwnfest?
  pulling piles of crap, nuking it down with AoE, gobbling up the nommage, etc.

add starting menu w/ ability to save/load/new game?
