IMPORTANT: Absolutely screw this for now rofl. The complexity of this absolutely exploded way beyond what I'm ready for. All I want out of this is a single map, a single player, my 10 cycling resources just like I had, and maybe 5 cycling enemies to kill that move around and attack back. Maybe build out a simple repair button and then probs leave it at that - end of the project

Next project should just be marginally more complex

# Loose ends priorities

add attack range level up?
  should attack range/resource collection range be the same thing?

what if there was a stun CD?
  combined with attack range increase, you could pretty much kite

what about rockets?

what about repairing away from base?
  what about a health potion or something?
  purchase the ability to heal at portals?

boss hp says 460% or something stupid - need to fix that, possibly show the actual HP number too

migrate the player/enemy portrait cards into the canvas?

add health bars above player/enemy during combat

add dmg numbers into canvas during combat

implement circling, where your range outranks the enemy's, enabling attacking without receiving dmg?

add stat increases on level up

add enemy targetting via mouse

what if there was good AoE and a very long-range, weak attack for pulling enemies?

what if I made this or another game like a Diablo-oriented pwnfest?
  pulling piles of crap, nuking it down with AoE, gobbling up the nommage, etc.

add starting menu w/ ability to save/load/new game?

# --------------------------------------

You win on boss kill

Enemy aggression on 1-4

& Success banner no move screen

Fix health not healing after level up or HP up?

Fix 460% health or whatever
